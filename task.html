					OK, a few more things before we begin:
				</p>
				<p>
					(1) if you are using a laptop, PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS PLUGGED INTO AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE.  It is important that your computer not go into "sleep mode" during the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					(2) If the screen is not maximized, please maximize this screen on your computer so that everything will display properly.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Record the size of the screen to make sure it is the same size across all screens
				</p>
				<p>
					(3) Please make sure the sound on your computer is turned on, because later on there will be a beep indicating that there are some questions to anwer.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I don't believe there is any sound in this setup, but double check this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please click 'Next' when you have taken care of these two things.

					Thank you for participating in our study today.  We are interested in a very simple question, namely how people pass the time when they have nothing to do.
				</p>
				<p><b><u>
					What you will be doing
				</u></b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In a few minutes, you will be asked to sit by yourself in your room (without getting up to walk around or falling asleep), in what we will call the "Free Time" Period, which will last from 10-15 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>First, you will receive some instructions for the Free Time Period.
					</li>
					<li>
						Second, you will be asked to follow those instructions for the 10-15 minute Free Time Period
					</li>
					<li>
						Third, you will answer some questions on the computer.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Click 'Next'for further instructions.</p>
				<p class="note">
					NEED TO RANDOMIZE PEOPLE HERE!
