				<p>
					(1) if you are using a laptop, PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS PLUGGED INTO AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE.  It is important that your computer not go into "sleep mode" during the study.

					(2) If the screen is not maximized, please maximize this screen on your computer so that everything will display properly.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Record the size of the screen to make sure it is the same size across all screens
