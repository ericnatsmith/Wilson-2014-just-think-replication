				</p>
				<p>
					(1) if you are using a laptop, PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS PLUGGED INTO AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE.  It is important that your computer not go into "sleep mode" during the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					(2) If the screen is not maximized, please maximize this screen on your computer so that everything will display properly.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Record the size of the screen to make sure it is the same size across all screens
				</p>
				<p>
					(3) Please make sure the sound on your computer is turned on, because later on there will be a beep indicating that there are some questions to anwer.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I don't believe there is any sound in this setup, but double check this.
